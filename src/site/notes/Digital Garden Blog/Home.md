**Welcome to my Digital garden!**
As a technologist I am always looking for new ways to express my thoughts, write down what I am doing, and pass on some knowledge to someone else.

To use [[Digital Garden Blog/AI\|AI]] to help you with learning you need to almost redefine how you take notes. AI likes documents in a text format, it is easier for them to read, enter Obsidian.
Obsidian is a powerful note-taking and knowledge management application built on the principles of Markdown...

**Artificial Intelligence**
I have embarked on a journey to learn as much as possible about Artificial Intelligence ([[Digital Garden Blog/AI\|AI]]) and its potential applications. My primary motivation stems from a desire to work smarter, not harder. I firmly believe that success and career advancement should not necessitate working 60 hours a week.
I believe that many of the mundane daily tasks performed by technicians can be automated. I also believe that the majority of the emails I receive are non-essential. Many of my daily tasks could be completed, and possibly automated, by AI, with me overseeing the LLM's work to ensure it meets company standards.
I believe that, instead of spending time fixing old and outdated systems, I should focus on learning about and implementing new technologies to enhance the company's profitability and simplify operations.

I have been using Fabric as Augmentation to absorb data faster. YouTube is an awesome resource for learning, but it is very time consuming to go through all the data/Videos to find what I need to learn. [[Digital Garden Blog/Fabric\|Fabric]] creates prompts to have [[Digital Garden Blog/AI\|AI]] parse this data for you, and get you watching what you should be watching.
