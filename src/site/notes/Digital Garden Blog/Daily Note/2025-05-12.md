### Tasks
Pricing on Clean Topsoil
Pricing on Clean Sand
Ensure that my Boat will be ready for Wednesday

## Ideas
I used Web-UI - which is a python script from https://github.com/browser-use/web-ui that uses [[Digital Garden Blog/AI\|AI]]to do deep research. I created a prompt that calculated square footage of the current prices of clean topsoil in New Brunswick, Canada. The output was given to me in Cubic Yards, which is what most vendors sell this product as. 
## Favorite Moments
My prompt above worked.
## Journal

I was able to get the majority of my tasks completed today. I was on the phone several times looking for sand and clean topsoil. This is all for a landscaping project that we are doing to fix our backyard and make it look nice. Due to the renovation of our house in the last year, the back yard was torn up a bit.

Our plan is to create a stone walkway to the garage, and off to the side towards the end or start of our driveway. We have gotten several quotes from landscaping companies that seemed to be very **Expensive** . So we will do this a different way. We will pay for a local guy to do a bit of excavating for us to level the land. Then but the stones and make the walkway ourselves. We will buy clean topsoil locally and shape the lawn, and plant grass ourselves.

This should be a good project that will keep me busy for a bit. I will post our progress.
