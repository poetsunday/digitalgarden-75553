## Journal

Well yesterday started good, I have been working as per usual at me job. Then going out side to work on the landscaping of our property.

The walkway is completed from the house to garage, once I got going laying the blocks went pretty quick. There are still stones that wiggle a little, I'll let them settle, then go back to fix them.
The grass is starting to grow on the seeded parts of our lawn. I have raked the un-seeded areas now and seeded them with grass.
