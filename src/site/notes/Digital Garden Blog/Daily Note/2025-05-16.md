## Journal
It is the start of the long weekend in May. The morning started out a little over cast, and I believe we are expecting some rain this weekend. 
I had a couple of visitors in from of my place this morning. The loons are always a bit majestic, the site of them brings calm to my thoughts.

## Favorite Moments
The end of the work week. Having my wife come home in a happy mood, she had good day visiting with her mother and sister
 ## Ideas
Emotional Intelligence ([[Digital Garden Blog/7 EQ Exercises\|EQ]]) - I want to do a bit of research on this, I believe it will help me with my own communication skills, at which I know are poor, and help me with my journey to learn efficiently.
