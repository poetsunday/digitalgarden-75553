## Journal
Its the Monday of the long weekend in May. We drove to Perth-Andover yesterday to visit my wife's side of the family and have dinner. We spent a wonderful couple of hours playing with our Granddaughter.

The Dogs had me up at 6 am this morning as per normal. It is a rainy over cast day.

I am going through a tutorial by "Wonderloots" - https://wanderloots.xyz/digital-garden/templates/notes-created-today-code-block/ on adding some new functionality to my learning process and how I organize my notes with [[Digital Garden Blog/Obsidian\|Obsidian]]. The goal is to integrate AI Augmentation, leveraging [[Digital Garden Blog/AI\|AI]] to learn more efficiently. I'll attach the video below.

What I am trying to do is automatically produce a list of Notes that I have updated on my Home page. I am hoping to do this with the Dataview and Templater, that will automatically create a table on my Home page.
