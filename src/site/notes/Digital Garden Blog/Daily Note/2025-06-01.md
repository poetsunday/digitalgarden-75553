## Journal

We started making our own bread at our home instead of buying. My wife tells me this is the first steps to homesteading. Her is the recipe that we use:
### Home made Bread:
2 cups warm water
1 Tbsp of Dry active yeast
2 Tbsp of olive oil
Mix this together and allow the yeast to activate.

4 - 5 & 1/2 Cups AP Flour
2 Tsp salt
Mix the 4 1/2 of the flour together with the salt, set a 1/2 cup of the flour aside to need in the dough.

I used a mixer with a dough hook, once the yeast have activated, turn the mixer on low and slowly ad the slat and flour mixture. Need for 5 minutes. When dough has formed into a ball, remove from the mixture and need in the rest of the flour. *This mixture can be incorporated and needed by hand if you do not have a mixer.* Form into a ball and allow the dough to rise for a approximately 1 hour. 

Grease 2 bread pans and divide the dough into 2 loafs, and allow to rise again for another hour.

Pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees F, bake for 30 min. 
Baste some butter on top when you remove from the oven.
