## Journal

I did a bit of landscaping today, I had to shut the dogs in the house, as they insisted on helping. But I really needed them to stay off my sand.

This took me the better part of 3 hours to complete in Total...

I think I did a good job. There are a couple of stones that I need to go back and level again, as they have a very slight wobble.

I'm not completely finished as this walkway will extend out to my garage. It will take some time. The important thing for me, and it will be a learning curve on my own [[Emotional Intelligence\|Emotional Intelligence]], and that will be not rushing to get this project completed. I need to take my time and do this correctly. Patience is going to be my secret weapon here.  
## Favorite Moments

Working by myself, and completing the goals that I set for myself today, I got a good feeling after I accomplished the tasks that I setout to do. The take away from this is to not let comments or critic from anyone ruin what I was able to do. I know I did a good job, it may not be perfect. But the methods were solid.
## Ideas

Do not let anyone rush you, if you want to do a good job, remember the quote from the movie *Shooter*, "Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast!"
